        Easter Island is a tiny isolated island in the Pacific Ocean. Its existence was only discovered by
        the western world in 1772. A Dutch explorer landed on the island and was shocked to see the few
        inhabitants living in squalor with very few obvious resources.

        What amazed these European visitors was that amongst this squlaor and barbarism, there was evidence of
        a once flourishing and sophisticated society. The island was dotted with fabulous giant carved stone
        heads that indicated an advanced society once existed on the island, who had a detailed knowledge of
        construction and astronomy.
