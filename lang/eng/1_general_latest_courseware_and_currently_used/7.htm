<h1>Wide Screen with Image</h1>
<p>Easter Island is a tiny isolated island in the Pacific Ocean. Its existence was only discovered by the western world in 1772. A Dutch explorer landed on the island and was shocked to see the few inhabitants living in squalor with very few obvious resources.</p>
<p>What amazed these European visitors was that amongst this squlaor and barbarism, there was evidence of a once flourishing and sophisticated society. The island was dotted with fabulous giant carved stone heads that indicated an advanced society once existed on the island, who had a detailed knowledge of construction and astronomy.</p>
